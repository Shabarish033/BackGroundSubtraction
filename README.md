# BackGroundSubtraction
In this code we describe a method to remove the background from a reference video, and add this to another video. For more details refer to: https://medium.com/@shabarish033/opencv-background-subtraction-and-music-in-background-of-video-c8fe10b66bc8

To run the code, ensure that for the initial frame, ie. when the webcam video stream is started the object (Person) is absent.
